# Hi, I'm Rayane

I initially worked as a full-stack web developer, developing applications across both the frontend and backend. Over time, I developed a strong interest in the operational and infrastructure aspects of software delivery, which led me to transition toward Cloud and DevOps practices. I approach my work through continuous learning and hands-on experimentation, with a focus on building reliable, maintainable, and secure systems.

## Experience

My experience is primarily built through end-to-end practical projects within my Kubernetes homelab. I work on full deployment pipelines, infrastructure automation, secret management, policy enforcement, and observability. This hands-on approach allows me to validate architectural decisions and continuously improve my operational skills.

## Tech Stack

* **Programming languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Go (beginner)
* **Cloud technologies:** Kubernetes, AWS, Docker
* **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Express
* **DevOps:** GitLab CI, Terraform, Ansible

## Objective

I am currently looking for opportunities in Cloud, DevOps, or Platform Engineering roles, where I can contribute to building maintainable and reliable delivery platforms while continuing to grow professionally.
